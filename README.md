# Indicators 

## Core Financial Metrics
### These give fundamental insights into the company's health:
Revenue (TTM / quarterly)	Shows top-line growth; trending up = healthy business
EPS (Earnings Per Share)	Profitability per share; often drives stock price
PE Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)	Valuation metric: is the stock over/undervalued?
Forward PE	Expected valuation based on forecasted earnings
Price-to-Sales (P/S)	Good for early-stage or low-profit companies
Price-to-Book (P/B)	Useful for asset-heavy companies (banks, real estate)
Market Cap	Size of the company (Large-cap vs Small-cap behaviors differ)
Dividend Yield	Shows income potential; relevant for passive investors

## Volatility & Risk
Beta	You already have this — market-relative volatility
Standard Deviation (Volatility)	Pure statistical risk; great for comparisons
Average True Range (ATR)	Measures daily price movement; good for traders
Sharpe Ratio	Risk-adjusted return (if you ever calculate returns)

Technical Indicators
Used heavily by swing traders and active investors:

Indicator	Why It's Useful
RSI (Relative Strength Index)	Shows if stock is overbought (>70) or oversold (<30)
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)	Trend-following momentum indicator
Bollinger Bands	Price range + volatility — helps identify breakouts
Volume	Confirms price moves (spikes often precede price changes)
